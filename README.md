# Desktop-application-for-pharmacy
In this project, I have built a user-friendly interface that enables fast data storing
and manipulation. The purpose of the project is to enable keeping track of
business-related information such as drug information, drug availability, employees,
receipts etc. For GUI I have used javax library and for database, I have used SQL
which will be connected through JDBC driver.
